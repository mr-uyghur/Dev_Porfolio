    "about": " Hello! I'm Ali Imran Halmamat, a dedicated full stack developer with a passion for crafting end-to-end digital solutions. With over 5 years of experience under my belt, I've honed my skills in  'React, Node.js, Django and MongoDB', ensuring that both the front and back ends of any application I build are seamless, efficient, and robust. Beyond the code, I pride myself on my ability to communicate effectively with teams and stakeholders, always ensuring that technical jargon is translated into clear, actionable insights. In my downtime, I enjoy reading, going to the gym, learning new technologies and self development in general. If you're looking for a developer who's as enthusiastic about clean code as they are about effective collaboration, let's chat!",
